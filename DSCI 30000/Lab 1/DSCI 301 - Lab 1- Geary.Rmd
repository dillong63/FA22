1. Use R to find out What is three to the power of four 

```{r}
3^4
```


2. Create a vector called scores with the following data points: 23,27,23,21,34.

```{r}

scores <- c(23,27,23,21,34)

scores
```

3. Assign names, for example days of the week, to the scores data points.

```{r}
names(scores) <- c("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thur", "Fri")

scores
```


4. What was the average (mean) of the above score?

```{r}
mean(scores)
```

5. What was the highest score?

```{r}
max(scores)
```

6. What was the lowest score?

```{r}
min(scores)
```

7. Create a vector called over.23 consisting of logicals that correspond to scores more than 23. 

```{r}
over.23 <- scores > 23

over.23

```

8. Use the over.23 vector to filter out the vector and only return where the score was over 23.


```{r}

scores[over.23]

```
