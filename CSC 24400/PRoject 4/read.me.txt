There are no special steps needed to compile the program
My program has no bugs I am aware of
I just adjusted my program with what we learned in class
and setup some recursive function for my copy helper and to see
if two sets are the same using ==. At first my copy helper did not work at all
as it was causing everything else not to work tha twas returning *this
but that was because I forgot that I needed to also link up the parents. After
fixing this the rest seemed to tick by.
